# Stayvillow Sidebar Technical Requirements

This document outlines the technical requirements and considerations for implementing the sidebar enhancements.

## Frontend Requirements

### Component Structure
- Maintain modular component architecture
- Create separate components for each major section:
  - `ProfileSection.tsx`
  - `MessagingCenter.tsx`
  - `TravelTools.tsx`
  - `RewardsProgram.tsx`
  - `TravelPlanning.tsx`
  - `SettingsPanel.tsx`
  - `HelpResources.tsx`

### State Management
- Use React context for global state (theme, currency preferences)
- Leverage local component state for UI interactions
- Implement proper loading states for asynchronous data

### Dependencies
- Ensure all required npm packages are documented and versioned
- Minimize additional bundle size impact:
  - Use dynamic imports for less frequently accessed features
  - Consider code splitting for larger components

## API Requirements

### New Endpoints Needed
- `/api/user/profile-completion` - Get profile completion status
- `/api/messages/unread-count` - Get count of unread messages
- `/api/rewards/status` - Get user's rewards program status
- `/api/user/recently-viewed` - Get recently viewed properties
- `/api/user/saved-searches` - Get user's saved searches

### Data Models
- Define clear interfaces for all data structures:
  ```typescript
  interface ProfileData {
    completionPercentage: number;
    verifiedItems: {
      email: boolean;
      phone: boolean;
      id: boolean;
    };
    // ...
  }
  ```

## Performance Considerations

### Rendering Optimization
- Implement proper memoization for expensive components
- Use virtualization for long lists (recently viewed, messages)
- Ensure sidebar initial load is optimized (<150ms target)

### Network Optimization
- Implement data caching strategies
- Use stale-while-revalidate pattern for freshness
- Consider offline support for critical features

## Security Requirements

### Authentication
- Ensure proper role-based access controls for all features
- Implement secure handling of user preferences
- Apply appropriate data sanitization for user inputs

### Privacy
- Define clear data retention policies for user activity
- Ensure GDPR compliance for user tracking features
- Implement appropriate user consent mechanisms

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Create comprehensive test coverage for all new components
- Test role-based rendering for all user types
- Test accessibility compliance

### Integration Tests
- Test sidebar integration with main application
- Verify data flow between sidebar and server APIs
- Test responsive behavior across breakpoints

### Performance Tests
- Measure and establish baseline performance metrics
- Set performance budgets for component rendering time
- Test impact on application overall load time

## Accessibility Requirements

- Implement proper ARIA attributes for dynamic content
- Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
- Support screen readers with appropriate markup
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Test with assistive technologies
